# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and Pygame. The game features basic controls for moving the snake to collect targets, which increase the snake's length. Each game continues until the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the game window.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive arrow key controls (W, A, S, D).
- Score tracking with the score displayed in the top-left corner.
- Game Over logic with a restart capability by pressing any movement key after the game ends.
- Prevents the snake from reversing direction directly.

## Requirements

To run this game, you need Python and Pygame installed on your system. Python 3.6 or higher is recommended for better compatibility. You can install Pygame using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```
# Running the Game

To start the game, run the Python script from your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python snake_game.py
```
Ensure that the script name matches the actual name of your Python file.

Controls
- **W**: Move Up
- **S**: Move Down
- **A**: Move Left
- **D**: Move Right
To restart the game after a game over, press any of the movement keys.

Enjoy the game and try to beat your high score!
